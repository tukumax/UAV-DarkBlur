# UAV-DarkBlur
A Comprehensive Benchmark for Low-Light UAV Image Enhancement and Deblurring

UAV-DarkBlur is a large-scale, high-resolution (1920×1080) benchmark designed for Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Deblurring in aerial photography, comprising both synthetic and real-world subsets. It is specifically tailored to capture not only rich aerial textures and diverse scenes but also real-time flight status parameters. By integrating visual data with precise flight dynamics, UAV-DarkBlur bridges the gap in existing datasets and enables a new generation of physics-aware restoration algorithms.
